This is a simple user interface for a 'to-do list' application.

To use it, clone the repo and run npm install followed by npm start.

Enter a task that you wish to add to the to-do list, such as 'walk the dog', in the first input field labelled 'Task' 

Next select a due date for the task using the date picker labelled 'Due'.

Click the 'add' button or hit return. 

Your task will appear in your to-do list. You can add as many tasks as you like, in the same manner.

To archive a task as completed, press the 'done' button. To remove a task that you no longer wish to complete, press 'delete'.

If you accidentally archive a task that is not complete, you can return it to the active tasks list by clicking 'restore'.
